# Java Banking System 1 - Bank

This project implements a simple **banking system** in Java, designed to test your understanding of **classes**, **encapsulation**, and **basic data structures**. You are given prewritten tests â€” your task is to implement the logic in the `Bank` and `BankAccount` classes to make all tests pass.

---

## ðŸ§© The Task

You must **implement the missing logic** in the following files:

- `Bank.java`
- `BankAccount.java`

Look for the `TODO` comments in each file. The unit tests in `BankTest.java` will check that:

- Customers can be registered with an initial deposit.
- Deposits correctly increase the account balance.
- Withdrawals only work if there's enough money.
- Transfers between two registered accounts work correctly and only succeed if the sender has sufficient funds.
